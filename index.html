<p class="indent">
    My name is Daniel, and I am a new student in this class. I have a strong interest in technology,
    particularly in web development, ICT, and software engineering, and I am fascinated by how
    websites
    and applications are designed, built, and maintained to solve real-world problems. I enjoy
    learning
    new concepts, building practical projects, debugging code, and collaborating with others to
    develop
    effective solutions. In addition to my technical interests, I value teamwork, creativity, and
    continuous improvement, and I believe that learning is most effective when ideas are shared and
    challenges are approached collaboratively. Through this class, I hope to strengthen my
    foundational skills, gain hands-on experience, and better understand best practices in modern
    web
    development. I am really looking forward to learning from this class, exchanging ideas with my
    classmates, and working together on projects throughout the course. Nice to meet you all!
