    <h1>Daniel Abughdyer | WDD 130</h1>
    <p>My name is Daniel, and I am a new student in this class. I have a strong interest in technology,
    especially in web development, ICT, and software engineering. I enjoy learning new things, solving
    problems, and collaborating with others.
    I am really looking forward to learning from this class, sharing ideas, and working together with
    everyone. Nice to meet you all!</p>
